Binary Search Algorithm: The basic steps to perform Binary Search are:

Sort the array in ascending order.
Set the low index to the first element of the array and the high index to the last element.
Set the middle index to the average of the low and high indices.
If the element at the middle index is the target element, return the middle index.
If the target element is less than the element at the middle index, set the high index to the middle index â€“ 1.
If the target element is greater than the element at the middle index, set the low index to the middle index + 1.
Repeat steps 3-6 until the element is found or it is clear that the element is not present in the array.
 
Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in the following two ways

Iterative Method
Recursive Method
1. Iteration Method

    binarySearch(arr, x, low, high)
        repeat till low = high
               mid = (low + high)/2
                   if (x == arr[mid])
                   return mid
   
                   else if (x > arr[mid]) // x is on the right side
                       low = mid + 1
   
                   else                  // x is on the left side
                       high = mid - 1

                       
2. Recursive Method (The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach)

    binarySearch(arr, x, low, high)
           if low > high
               return False 
   
           else
               mid = (low + high) / 2 
                   if x == arr[mid]
                   return mid
       
               else if x > arr[mid]        // x is on the right side
                   return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
               
               else                        // x is on the left side
                   return binarySearch(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
