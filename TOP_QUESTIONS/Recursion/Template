/*Identify the base case(s): Determine when the recursion should stop. 
This is typically the simplest possible input or the smallest subproblem.

Define the recursive case: Define how the problem should be broken down into smaller subproblems.

Write the function: Write a function that takes the input and breaks it down into
 smaller subproblems until it reaches the base case.
*/
// Example:
public int solveRecursion(int input) {
  // Base case(s)
  if (input <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  // Recursive case
  return solveRecursion(input - 1) + input;
}
//Note: This is just a basic template and can be adapted to the specific requirements of different problems.
