/*Here is a template for solving a LeetCode question using the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in Java:
 * The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in a breadthward motion. It starts at a given source vertex, explores all its neighbors, then moves to their neighbors, and so on, until all vertices have been visited.

 * Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the BFS algorithm works:

 * Choose a starting vertex and mark it as visited.
 * Enqueue the starting vertex into a queue (FIFO data structure).
 * While the queue is not empty:
 * Dequeue a vertex from the queue.
 * Process the dequeued vertex (e.g., print it or perform some operation on it).
 * Enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the dequeued vertex into the queue and mark them as visited.
 * Repeat steps 3 until the queue is empty.
 * The key difference between DFS and BFS lies in the order in which they explore the vertices. 
 * While DFS explores the graph as deeply as possible before backtracking, BFS explores the graph layer by layer.
