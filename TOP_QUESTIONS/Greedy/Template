 //Example: 
 public int solve(int[] coins, int amount) {
    // initialize variables
    int totalCoins = 0;
    int remainingAmount = amount;

    // sort coins in descending order
    Arrays.sort(coins);
    for (int i = coins.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        // make greedy choice by using as many of the largest coin as possible
        int coin = coins[i];
        int coinCount = remainingAmount / coin;
        remainingAmount -= coinCount * coin;
        totalCoins += coinCount;
    }

    // return total number of coins used
    return totalCoins;
}
/*
 * This example uses greedy strategy of always choosing the largest coin that is less than
 *  or equal to the remaining amount. The coins are sorted in descending order,
 *  so the largest coin is always used first. This problem can be solved by this algorithm with
 *  time complexity of O(nlogn), where n is the number of coins.
 *  Keep in mind that this is just one example of a greedy algorithm,
 *  and the specific implementation will vary depending on the problem being solved.
